Pair-end 150bp sequencing reads were generated using Illumina NovaSeq 6000 technology
Followed GATK best practices to process alignment files, call and filter variants
Variants were called for each population separately
Merged variants together for all populations
Missing genotypes were identified and filled in using GATK --all-sites option for each population
